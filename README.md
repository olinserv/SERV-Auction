SERV Auction Python Files
=========================

This repository contains all of the scripts you will need for managing the hundreds of transactions involved in the SERV Auction. There are two pieces.

1. `print_bids.py` converts a CSV of donations into a Tex file of bid sheets that you can then compile and print in your preferred TeX compiler. I recommend one that handles unicode, since that has a tendency to pop up.
2. `send_emails.py` takes a CSV of information about items and winners and sends them all emails either confirming that they paid or reminding them to do so.

Both scripts should be run in Python 3.5+ for best results. They might work in other versions, but I haven't tried it. More specific details on how to use each script can be found in the files.

If you have questions, email JustinKunimune@gmail.com, since I'm the person writing this README.
