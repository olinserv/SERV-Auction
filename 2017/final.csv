Mel Chua,mel@melchua.com,Alum,ASL STEM Immersion Trip,"Ever wanted to experience engineering in a different language and culture without leaving the USA? Come hang out with Deaf engineers in Rochester at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf! No ASL knowledge required; we've got interpreters, keyboards, and notebooks and can teach you how to adapt to being ""sign-impaired"" if needed. Might be a particularly fun trip for those who work with the medical and/or disability community and want to see what it's like on the other side of things.
  
  I (Mel) was the first deaf Olin student ('07) and a recent Olin postdoc, and am now a new RIT/NTID faculty member. I'll be your host into a world where sign language is normal and engineering faculty and students play with and question their relationships with assistive/adaptive technology on a daily basis. My research center is a product design group staffed entirely by d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing engineers (imagine ""Deaf IDEO"" and you'll be pretty close). Our city has the highest per capita Deaf population in the world, which means signing baristas, waiters who automatically write down the specials, and all sorts of lovely little tweaks in a world that's made with very different assumptions than the hearing norm. And now you, too, can experience an alternate engineering universe.
  
  This item covers an all-expenses-paid trip to Rochester (you get yourself to/from Rochester we'll handle the rest) for up to 10 days for up to two people. Private guest room, real twin mattresses, and all the food and tea and coffee you want with any dietary needs accommodated. Scheduling done by mutual agreement. Airport pick-up included if needed, transit around the city available. Rochester is a 6-hour drive from Boston and has gorgeous hiking/lakes/beaches/etc. nearby, and these can easily be worked into your trip, with as much free/solo time as you want to have and automotive transit available if needed. I'll work with you to design a schedule around your interests and set up meetings/excursions/experiences with various people around town (Deaf science? Art? Theatre? Dance? You name it, we've got it). As a bonus, I'm also happy to teach cartooning, qualitative research methods, RSI prevention, and/or cooking, and can give plenty of advice on grad school and/or feedback on writing.
  
  This item must be redeemed while I am working at RIT, which will be at least until August 2018, but may extend for longer.",Miscellaneous,30,"Alumi, Students, Faculty and Staff",Anika,anika.payano@students.olin.edu,$150.00,Michael,2017-11-13 17:03

Joe Sutker,Joe@students.olin.edu,Student,Ron's Snacks Easter Egg,"Do you have a favorite food that you want to star in AVPM? Do you want to watch me eat something weird? Do you like forcing people to do your bidding in a really subtle way? Then this is the item for you.
  
  I'm playing Ron Weasley in the upcoming FWOP performance, and I will be eating various snacks on stage. For the measly price of whatever you end up winning with, you get to pick a snack for me to eat during the show. The top three bidders each get to choose a snack (one for each night) that I will eat. I will try to finish your snack of choice before leaving the stage. Your choice will be subject to director approval, but keep in mind that I will eat most things.
  
  Rules:
  - cannot be alive (can have been alive at one point)
  - must be at least technically edible
  - nothing illegal
  - nothing that will put me or my fellow cast members in danger (specifically peanuts are not allowed, no matter how delicious)
  - I must be able to hold it reasonably
  - must be reasonably priced (no caviar)",Events,1,"Alumi, Students, Faculty and Staff, Anyone who comes to see the show",William Lu,william.lu@students.olin.edu,$4.00,PayPal,2017-11-13 17:02
