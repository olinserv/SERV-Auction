Come hang out with Deaf engineers in Rochester at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf!

Might be a particularly fun trip for those who work with the medical and/or disability community and want to see what it's like on the other side of things.

I (Mel) was the first deaf Olin student ('07) and a recent Olin postdoc, and am now a new RIT/NTID faculty member. I'll be your host into a world where sign language is normal and engineering faculty and students play with and question their relationships with assistive/adaptive technology on a daily basis. My research center is a product design group staffed entirely by d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing engineers (imagine ""Deaf IDEO"" and you'll be pretty close). Our city has the highest per capita Deaf population in the world, which means signing baristas, waiters who automatically write down the specials, and all sorts of lovely little tweaks in a world that's made with very different assumptions than the hearing norm. And now you, too, can experience an alternate engineering universe.

This item covers an all-expenses-paid trip to Rochester (you get yourself to/from Rochester we'll handle the rest) for up to 10 days for up to two people. Private guest room, real twin mattresses, and all the food and tea and coffee you want with any dietary needs accommodated. Scheduling done by mutual agreement. Airport pick-up included if needed, transit around the city available. Rochester is a 6-hour drive from Boston and has gorgeous hiking/lakes/beaches/etc. nearby, and these can easily be worked into your trip, with as much free/solo time as you want to have and automotive transit available if needed. I'll work with you to design a schedule around your interests and set up meetings/excursions/experiences with various people around town (Deaf science? Art? Theatre? Dance? You name it, we've got it). As a bonus, I'm also happy to teach cartooning, qualitative research methods, RSI prevention, and/or cooking, and can give plenty of advice on grad school and/or feedback on writing.
